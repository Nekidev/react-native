# Logto React Native (Expo) sample

This is the sample app using [Logto React Native SDK](../rn/) with [Expo](https://expo.dev/) managed workflow.

## Get started

Replace the following parameters in `App.tsx` with your Logto project's values:

```ts
const redirectUri = 'io.logto://callback';
const endpoint = 'https://<your-logto-endpoint>';
const appId = '<your-app-id>';
```

Then run the app for development.
